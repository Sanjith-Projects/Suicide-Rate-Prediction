# Suicide-Rate-Prediction

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of smoking data in the UK. By examining smoking prevalence, trends, and associated factors, we aim to gain insights into the smoking patterns within the population. This analysis will contribute to the development of targeted interventions, public health initiatives, and smoking cessation programs to reduce smoking rates and improve public health outcomes.
