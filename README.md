# Suicide-Rate-Prediction

 The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for suicide rates using socio-economic data. By exploring various factors such as economic indicators, mental health services accessibility, and social factors, we aim to develop a model that can forecast suicide rates in different populations. The insights derived from this analysis can help inform suicide prevention efforts and support mental health initiatives.
